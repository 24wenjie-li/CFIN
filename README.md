# CFIN

This repository is an official PyTorch implementation of our paper "Cross-receptive Focused Inference Network for Lightweight Image Super-Resolution". 

## Dataset
We used only DIV2K dataset to train our model. Please download it from <a href="https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/">here</a>.

Extract the file and place it in the same location as args.data_dir in option.py.

## Results
All our Supplementary materials can be downloaded from <a href="https://pan.baidu.com/s/176mlyl3Td8l_XI6fvTQvyQ">here</a>.[百度网盘][提取码:8888]
